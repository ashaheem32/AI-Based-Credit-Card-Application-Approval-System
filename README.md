## 🧠 Project Overview

- **Objective**: To develop a predictive model that automates credit card approval using machine learning techniques.
- **Scope**: The system uses demographic and financial data to classify applications into approved or rejected categories.

---

## 📊 Dataset

- **Source**: [UCI Machine Learning Repository - Credit Approval Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/credit+approval)
- **Features**: Includes attributes such as `Age`, `Employment Status`, `Total Bill Amount`, `Annual Income`, and more.
- **Preprocessing**:
  - Handled missing values
  - Encoded categorical variables
  - Normalized numerical features
  - Feature selection based on correlation and domain logic

## ⚙️ Machine Learning Models

The following models were trained and evaluated:

| Model                  | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
|------------------------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Random Forest          | 87.86%   | 0.88      | 0.88   | 0.88     |
| Logistic Regression    | 86.88%   | 0.86      | 0.86   | 0.86     |
| Decision Tree          | 83.61%   | 0.83      | 0.84   | 0.83     |
| K-Nearest Neighbors    | 85.25%   | 0.85      | 0.85   | 0.85     |

> **Best Performer**: Random Forest showed the highest accuracy and generalization.
